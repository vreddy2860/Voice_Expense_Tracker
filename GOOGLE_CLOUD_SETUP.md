# ðŸ”§ Google Cloud Speech API Setup

## Why This is Needed

The Voice Expense Tracker uses Google Speech API to convert your voice recordings into text. Without this setup, voice recording will work but won't transcribe the audio.

## ðŸš€ Quick Setup Steps

### 1. Create Google Cloud Project
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Click "Select a project" â†’ "New Project"
3. Name it: `voice-expense-tracker`
4. Click "Create"

### 2. Enable Speech-to-Text API
1. In the Google Cloud Console, go to "APIs & Services" â†’ "Library"
2. Search for "Speech-to-Text API"
3. Click on it and click "Enable"

### 3. Create Service Account
1. Go to "IAM & Admin" â†’ "Service Accounts"
2. Click "Create Service Account"
3. Name: `voice-expense-tracker-service`
4. Description: `Service account for Voice Expense Tracker`
5. Click "Create and Continue"
6. Grant role: "Speech-to-Text User"
7. Click "Continue" â†’ "Done"

### 4. Create and Download Key
1. Click on your service account
2. Go to "Keys" tab
3. Click "Add Key" â†’ "Create new key"
4. Choose "JSON" format
5. Click "Create"
6. Save the downloaded file as `service-account-key.json`

### 5. Set Environment Variable
```bash
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/your/service-account-key.json"
```

### 6. Restart Backend
```bash
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate
python3 app.py
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Alternative: Manual Expense Entry

1. **Clicking the microphone** to record (it will show a message about setup)
2. **Adding expenses manually** by typing them in
3. **Using the expense management features** without voice transcription
